# Welcome to NodeSchool MK!

## The 1st NodeSchool MK will happen on March 29 @TNMOC (Bletchley Park)
**RSVP** [here]: (https://www.meetup.com/Girls-Code-Learn-to-Code-with-Other-Girls-and-Women/events/248726005/)

## What we'll do
Come to NodeSchool if you want to learn more about Javascript and Node.js. The meetup is suitable for all levels (even if you are a complete beginner!) and everyone is welcomed (boys girls and everyone else!). The meetup will be coached by the Node.js master himself, [P J Evans] (https://twitter.com/mrpjevans?lang=en). We will meet at the Girls Code office space in Bletchley Park. Space is limited, so do let us know if you won't be able to attend as soon as possible. We will meet for two hours to study the nodeschool workshops as seen [here]: (https://nodeschool.io/)

You'll use the terminal/command line to begin learning Node.js, an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node is a great way to get into full-stack JavaScript development.

You'll also have the opportunity to use nodeschool.io to learn Git, JavaScript and other useful technologies. There will be stickers for completing workshops! We can help you with the installation if necessary, but if you feel confident enough to install Node yourself and you already have a text-editor then that would be great.

Coffee, tea, and snacks will be provided (but bring your own if you have a special diet). Bring your laptop and charger. There's lots of free parking available and we are very close to the Bletchley train station. See you soon!

## What to bring
Bring your laptop!

## Important to know
At GirlsCode we believe in co-learning. Share what you know with others and help those that are less experienced than you are. Be kind.
